# Colorize-Grayscale-Image

Use CNN, GAN models to colorize grayscale and black-and-white images (NEU CS4100 Course Project / Capstone Project)

## Basic Analysis

We selected one CNN model and one GAN model to train a self-collected dataset. We compared the result and found that the GAN model performs significantly better than the CNN model. We have achieved the following result (tested with grayscale images):

However, we also found that the model performs less satisfying with black-and-white images, which is a direction we would like to explore more in the future. 

## Final Result (Black-and-White Images)
